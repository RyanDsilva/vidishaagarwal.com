    header: Background
    content: Amul, short for Anand Milk Union Limited, is India's leading
      manufacturer of milk and dairy products, specializing in butter, yogurt,
      ice cream, and cheese. Amul originated in 1946, in response to the
      exploitative practices of Polson Dairy (which procured milk from local
      farmers at low rates). The farmers formed their own co-operative. It was a
      symbol of protest. Amul is a cooperative brand managed by a cooperative
      body. Today, it is jointly owned by 36 lakh milk producers in Gujarat.

      Milk has been used to soften, nourish, and revitalize skin for thousands
      of years. The tradition of bathing in milk was started by queens and
      noblewomen in ancient India. Milk bathing is an Ayurvedic practice that
      cleanses the body, pampers the skin and calms the senses.

      The Indian skincare market is growing, and represents a tremendous opportunity to enter the space. The market is expected to cross 10 billion dollars by the end of the decade. Despite this fast-paced growth, the market lacks an accessible, down-to-earth skin care brand that is for India, by India.
