    content: Vidisha is all the good things. And if I list in alphabetical order...
      she's diligent, intelligent, talented, tasteful, thoughtful... you get the
      idea. And she constantly demonstrates the ability to make larger
      connections. It was a great pleasure meeting and working with her.

      Vidisha has been one of the most talented designers we had at The Turtle
      Story. Her passion and energy were contagious, uplifting the entire team
      and driving success in every project she was involved in. Vidisha's
      enthusiasm not only inspired her colleagues but also had a direct and
      positive impact on the outcomes we achieved.


      Vidisha's contributions to key projects like the IIJS exhibition, Smile Tribe, and TSDC have been invaluable. For a young designer with just a couple of years of experience, Vidisha demonstrates remarkable maturity in her thought process. Her ability to grasp complex design requirements is truly commendable. What really sets her apart, though, is her calm and composed approach towards any challenging situation—always with a smile. It's no surprise that she quickly became a favorite amongst our clients.


      Vidisha truly is an asset to any team, consistently bringing her fine blend of creativity, professionalism, and a client-focused approach.

    content: Vidisha has been one of my favourite people to work with. My brand is
      her baby as much as it is mine as it was the first branding project for
      her as well. Not only does she understand the creativity and vision of the
      brand but she also adds to the vision which is something that I love about
      her. With that said her problem-solving skills & availability at times
      when the brand needed to quickly change or adapt were admirable. I would
      highly recommend her talent! She is full of passion, creativity,
      discipline & adaptability.

      I had the pleasure of working with Vidisha on many projects, but the one
      that stands out was the JCK event in Las Vegas. From the outset, it was
      clear that she possessed a unique blend of vision and passion, which set
      her apart from the rest.

      Vidisha has a great eye for detail and coordinates exceptionally well with vendors. During the JCK, Las Vegas event, her ability to truly grasp the space and understand the intricacies of the project contributed immensely in making it a smooth experience . She didn’t just look at the big picture; she saw the details, ensuring that everything aligned perfectly.

      Vidisha brings passion, vision, and a deep understanding of her work to the table, making her an invaluable asset to any team. I highly recommend her to anyone seeking someone who can both lead and contribute meaningfully to any project.
