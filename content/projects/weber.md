        content_data: The World's number one grill manufacturer, Weber grills,
          experienced a 32% decline in market share since 2020. The struggles
          reflect the aging core grill-enthusiast audience and dwindling while
          interest among younger consumers.

        content_data: Grilling is considered a deeply gendered activity built on
          idealized nuclear family structures in America in the 50's. It's a
          classic family pastime with a perfect family in their backyard with
          kids on the table, the wife preparing sides and setting up the table,
          and the "man" or the father handling the grill.

        content_data: However, the definition of family is changing. There has been a
          30% decline in nuclear family households since the 1970s.  With
          changing family structures, grilling is losing relevance in culture as
          gender definitions and roles break away from the binary.

        content_data: The nuclear family audience that Weber has been targeting since
          1952 cannot sustain its business. Weber must look beyond the nuclear
          family with its rigid gender norms, to stay relevant to the culture
          today.

          To move beyond traditional gender stereotypes, Weber must center its
          brand on the true essence of the grill: gathering. The ritual isn’t
          defined by who stands over the flame, but by the community built
          around it—the shared stories, the connection, and the collective
          experience of a meal made with love.


          To grow, Weber must move beyond the middle-aged male demographic and embrace "Spirited Connectors"—a psychographic audience focused on bringing people together through shared experiences.

          The new positioning that captures this evolution is:

          Uncover the Love is a campaign that encapsulates the brand's new
          positioning, encouraging audiences to express their love to those they
          treasure the most.


          It is a statement that attests to the brand's ambition: to be the centerpiece around which all kinds of families gather and bond.
