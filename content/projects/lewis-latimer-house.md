          Located in Flushing, Queens, the Lewis Latimer House Museum honors the
          life of Lewis Howard Latimer, a self-taught polymath who helped
          develop major 19th-century inventions, including Edison's incandescent
          light bulb.


          For years, the brand honored Latimer's life as the inspiration for a noble mission: helping close the gap in equitable patenting for minority innovators. ***However, this limited its relevance among a broader audience.***

          Despite his circumstances, Latimer demonstrated immense bravery and
          courage - qualities that will always be needed in society, no matter
          how much progress has been made socially or technologically.


          ***Lewis Latimer's most powerful gift wasn't his inventions; it was his fearless approach to life and learning.***

          To reposition the brand from a ***static museum*** to a ***dynamic
          "Open House"*** that creates a space where Latimer's mindset comes to
          life.


          The House empowers underrepresented thinkers by providing a thinking playground to nurture their own Lewis Latimer Mindset. A dynamic space of exploration, experimentation, and collaboration.


          In turn, the House expands its lens beyond equitable patenting, ***granting it the flexibility to increase its impact*** through active engagement.

          and a Victorian-esque serif inspired by the home, the logo connects
          seemingly disparate elements to create a cohesive unit."
