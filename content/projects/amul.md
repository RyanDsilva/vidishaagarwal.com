        content_data: Amul, short for Anand Milk Union Limited, is India's leading
          manufacturer of milk and dairy products, specializing in butter,
          yogurt, ice cream, and cheese. Amul originated in 1946, in response to
          the exploitative practices of Polson Dairy (which procured milk from
          local farmers at low rates). The farmers formed their own
          co-operative. It was a symbol of protest. Amul is a cooperative brand
          managed by a cooperative body. Today, it is jointly owned by 36 lakh
          milk producers in Gujarat.

      The Insight:
      In India, milk is more than just food.

        content_data: Milk has been used to soften, nourish, and revitalize skin for
          thousands of years. The tradition of bathing in milk was started by
          queens and noblewomen in ancient India. Milk bathing is an Ayurvedic
          practice that cleanses the body, pampers the skin and calms the
          senses.

        content_data: The Indian skincare market is growing, and represents a tremendous
          opportunity to enter the space. The market is expected to cross 10
          billion dollars by the end of the decade. Despite this fast-paced
          growth, the market lacks an accessible, down-to-earth skin care brand
          that is for India, by India.

        content_data: Although some Indian brands promote products that feature the
          ingredient or incorporate the word "milk" into their product offering,
          they have been slow to adopt milk as a main ingredient. This leaves
          white space to capture this market and introduce a product that
          connects Indian skincare with this deeply rooted tradition.

        content_data: Today, consumers gravitate towards the brand because Amul is pure.
          It is known as a seal of freshness. Amul is accessible, as a market
          leader that is affordable and made for the everyman. Amul aims at the
          mainstream market in India and does not provide any luxury items;
          instead, they focus on giving the highest possible quality goods at
          reasonable costs.

          The brand extension must follow suit. Hence, a simple and easily
          accessible name that is for everybody - Amul Body. The brand will
          launch three products with the goodness of Milk:

          1. The Moisturizing face cream

          2. Hydrating body butter

          3. Soothing cleansing milk

        content_data: These names are simple with a touch of quirk, like Amul's brand
          personality. They further establish the goodness of milk and paint a
          picture of the different textures of milk products that are desirable
          for the skin.

        content_data: Traditionally, along with its positive skincare benefits, milk has
          been used as a form of a skin whitening in India. India has a long and
          complicated history of colorism, discriminating against citizens with
          darker skin tones, which stems from the history of the caste system,
          colonialism, and conflicting religious ideologies. Light skin is
          associated with power, elevated status, and beauty.

        content_data: Despite the lack of evidence, many people in India are impacted by
          the dark skin stigma, and seek remedies to change their bodies to
          conform to these outdated beauty norms. Amul Body will fight this
          stigma. To counteract the colorism associated with milk-based products
          and confront the stigma around dark skin head-on, Amul will emulate
          the Dove "Real Beauty" campaign for our Amul Body launch to show that
          all skin tones are beautiful.
