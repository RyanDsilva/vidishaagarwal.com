    header: Background
    content: >-
      Located in Flushing, Queens, the Lewis Latimer House Museum honors the
      life of Lewis Howard Latimer, a self-taught polymath who helped develop
      major 19th-century inventions, including Edison’s incandescent light bulb.

      For years, the brand honored Latimer’s life as the inspiration for a noble mission: helping close the gap in equitable patenting for minority innovators. ***However, this limited its relevance among a broader audience.***

    content: >-
      Despite his circumstances, Latimer demonstrated immense bravery and
      courage - qualities that will always be needed in society, no matter how
      much progress has been made socially or technologically.\

      ***Lewis Latimer’s most powerful gift wasn’t his inventions; it was his fearless approach to life and learning.***

    header: The Lewis Latimer Mindset
    content: >-
      Born to formerly enslaved parents, Latimer navigated immense challenges to
      become not only a renowned inventor, but a poet, father, and community
      leader. To capture his unique disposition, we introduced the “Lewis
      Latimer Mindset”: a kaleidoscopic approach that fearlessly engages with
      the world, regardless of its obstacles.

      This offered a powerful new anchor to ***evolve the brand*** and its operational model.

    header: Solution
    content: >-
      To reposition the brand from a ***static museum*** to a ***dynamic "Open
      House"*** that creates a space where Latimer’s mindset comes to life.


      The House empowers underrepresented thinkers by providing a thinking playground to nurture their own Lewis Latimer Mindset. A dynamic space of exploration, experimentation, and collaboration.

      In turn, the House expands its lens beyond equitable patenting, ***granting it the flexibility to increase its impact*** through active engagement.

    header: Visual Expression
    content: The visual identity reflects Latimer’s ***kaleidoscopic philosophy,***
      embodying a fluid and ever-evolving perspective that invites people to
      see, think, and engage in new and unexpected ways.

    header: The Logo
    content: >-
      The logo is a visual representation of Latimer’s profound belief in
      fostering collaborative environments to generate innovation. Using
      ***kaleidoscopic fragments*** to form the L, a geometric sans-serif, and a
      Victorian-esque serif inspired by the home, the logo connects seemingly
      disparate elements to create a cohesive unit.
