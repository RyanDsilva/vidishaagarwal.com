      Vidisha has been one of the most talented designers we had at The Turtle
      Story. Her passion and energy were contagious, uplifting the entire team
      and driving success in every project she was involved in. Vidisha's
      enthusiasm not only inspired her colleagues but also had a direct and
      positive impact on the outcomes we achieved.


      Vidisha's contributions to key projects like the IIJS exhibition, Smile Tribe, and TSDC have been invaluable. For a young designer with just a couple of years of experience, Vidisha demonstrates remarkable maturity in her thought process. Her ability to grasp complex design requirements is truly commendable. What really sets her apart, though, is her calm and composed approach towards any challenging situation—always with a smile. It's no surprise that she quickly became a favorite amongst our clients.


      Vidisha truly is an asset to any team, consistently bringing her fine blend of creativity, professionalism, and a client-focused approach.

    content: Vidisha has been one of my favourite people to work with. My brand is
      her baby as much as it is mine as it was the first branding project for
      her as well. Not only does she understand the creativity and vision of the
      brand but she also adds to the vision which is something that I love about
      her. With that said her problem-solving skills & availability at times
      when the brand needed to quickly change or adapt were admirable. I would
      highly recommend her talent! She is full of passion, creativity,
      discipline & adaptability.

      I had the pleasure of working with Vidisha on many projects, but the one
      that stands out was the JCK event in Las Vegas. From the outset, it was
      clear that she possessed a unique blend of vision and passion, which set
      her apart from the rest.

      Vidisha has a great eye for detail and coordinates exceptionally well with vendors. During the JCK, Las Vegas event, her ability to truly grasp the space and understand the intricacies of the project contributed immensely in making it a smooth experience . She didn’t just look at the big picture; she saw the details, ensuring that everything aligned perfectly.

      Vidisha brings passion, vision, and a deep understanding of her work to the table, making her an invaluable asset to any team. I highly recommend her to anyone seeking someone who can both lead and contribute meaningfully to any project.

    content: Vidisha has an expansive and nuanced way of thinking that allows her to
      attack a problem from seemingly hidden perspectives. We worked together
      over the course of our these at the Masters in Branding program. During
      that time, she was always on top of everything we had to do, and was great
      at delegating tasks to team members as well. I have had a wonderful
      experience working with her and would do so again in a heartbeat, given
      the opportunity. She is an incredibly valuable thinker and executer in any
      team she is a part of!

    content: I have worked and learned with Vidisha! Even though I was a newbie in
      the job and industry, she taught and inspired me to become a best version
      of myself professionally and personally. She takes up each challenge
      creatively, and brings out the most unique approach as the solution. She
      inspired me to think different! I would give anything to work with her
      again. She would take one thing at a time giving each problem its own
      process, yet multi-task her way to perfection for a quick turnaround. She
      is full of passion, creativity and love for what she does the best!

      Vidisha Agarwal entered our Masters in Branding program at the School of
      Visual Arts in September, 2023. I teach a course called, “The Meaning of
      Branded Objects” in the program’s first semester, so I get to see all our
      students in their very earliest days of classes. From the first week,
      Vidisha’s work showed a clear thinker’s comprehension of reading
      assignments and their relevance for the overall class objective to
      observe, reflect on, and understand human behavior. 

      The class requires students to make weekly posts about the most interesting brand activity (ad, video, social post) they’ve come upon in the last week. Vidisha’s posts were incisive and showed her semester-long growth in developing a frame of reference on brand psychology. The class’ main project calls on students to explore their own relationships with branded objects. Vidisha’s work in the weekly and long-term assignments was exemplary. I graded her performance as Exceeding Expectations for the semester.

      Second semester, Vidisha volunteered to be part of our annual Honors project. This is an elective course (held on Saturdays, in addition to their five-day-per-week classes) that students apply for based on their interest in the particular project. Honors projects entail working on a re-branding initiative with an actual client company or organization. 

      This year, that client was the \[Lewis Latimer House](https://www.lewislatimerhouse.org/about), a Flushing, Queens museum dedicated to raising public awareness of Latimer’s remarkable life and achievements. Latimer was an African-American son of enslaved parents who went on to extraordinary accomplishments, including being awarded several patents. Among his other inventions, he is credited with perfecting the filament element in Edison’s first lightbulb. 

      Vidisha’s application essay for the Honors project highlighted both her strategic and design talents as well as her passion for calling attention to the accomplishments of a person of color. Vidisha played a key role in developing the project’s strategy and creating the final re-branded design products. She was a confident member of the Honors team’s final presentation to the client’s executive group. The Latimer team was delighted with the results. 

      A few weeks ago, Vidisha asked to become one of my two Teaching Assistants for the Fall, 2024 semester. I enthusiastically accepted her request and look forward to her being a strong member of my teaching team and a key resource for students. 

      Vidisha is an intelligent, creative, enthusiastic, conscientious young woman. She is open to new ideas and eager to learn. Her warm, engaging personality quickly puts others at ease, making her an ideal teammate. She would be a valuable addition to strategic or implementation teams in practically any setting. I give her my highest recommendation.

    content: I was introduced to Vidisha by my friend and former colleague Lulu
      Raghavan, President of APAC for Landor, and was immediately impressed by
      Vidisha's keen interest in all aspects of branding. While initially she
      approached me for general career advice, I soon had a brand positioning
      project with a small college where I thought Vidisha could be very helpful
      in doing some competitive analysis for me. Her diligence, strategic
      insights and thoughtful contributions to the project were both highly
      professional and extremely contributory to its ultimate success. Vidisha
      is that rare young person in our field who has actual design chops of her
      own but is also able to think strategically, communicate clearly and
      analyze data effectively. I'm sure there will be many pathways open to her
      in time but she will be a strong asset to whatever client and/or
      organization engages her. On top of all of that, she also happens to be an
      extremely nice and considerate person and a true pleasure to work with.
      I'm grateful for the time we worked together and am very much looking
      forward to see where her interests and considerable talents take her!
